                In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:
                    the value 0 representing an empty cell;
                    the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
                    the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
                
                Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

                Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  
                If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

                Example 1:
                Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
                Output: 4

                Note:
                1 <= grid.length <= 10
                1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
                grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
